# Maze-Game-Console
A maze exploration game where the player controls a hero to slay monsters in a maze. The only way to kill a monster is to collect at least one power in the maze and spend that power in killing the monster. Whenever the hero reaches the cell with a power in it, the hero automatically gain that power and another power appears somewhere in the maze. If a monster and the hero occupy the same cell and the hero doesnâ€™t have any power to kill the monster, the hero dies and the player loses the game (note: it is possible to have more than one monster in the same cell, in that case the hero needs to have at least the equal number of power to kill all the monsters, otherwise the hero dies). Fortunately, the monsters are not very smart, so they cannot track the hero: they move pseudo-randomly and are not affected by where the hero is.
The player wins the game when the hero slays all the monsters (3 in this game) lurking in the maze.
